## Overview

Enterprise Java applications must meet large-scale and complex business requirements. This document systematically covers everything from functional and non-functional requirements to design principles and development processes, using **Jakarta EE 11** as the core technology, to provide guidelines for building a sustainable and extensible architecture.

Jakarta EE 11 is the latest enterprise Java platform based on **Java SE 21 LTS**, allowing the use of modern Java features such as Virtual Threads (Project Loom), Record classes, and Pattern Matching. It supports cloud-native development patterns and has high affinity with microservices architecture, containerization, and DevOps processes, making it a robust and standard-compliant platform that meets the modern demands of enterprise applications. As a vendor-neutral open-source technology, it helps avoid technology lock-in and ensures long-term maintainability.
