# 12-frontend-service

This is the front-end service for the ski sales system, built with Next.js and TypeScript. It provides the user interface for customers to manage their ski equipment, view information, and access AI support features.

## üîß Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Setting Environment Variables

1.  Copy the environment variable template:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

2.  Edit `.env.local` to change the settings:

    ```bash
    # Development environment settings
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
    NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_API_GATEWAY=false
    NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_DUMMY_USER=false
    ```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning**:

-   Do not commit `.env.local` to version control.
-   In a production environment, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_DUMMY_USER=true`.
-   In a production environment, use the API gateway (`NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_API_GATEWAY=true`).

## Getting Started

First, start the development server:

```bash
npx next dev --turbopack --port 3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Demo User (Development Only)

For testing purposes, a demo user is available in development mode:

-   **Email**: `demo@skiresort.com`
-   **Password**: `demo123`
-   **Features**: Access to AI support and all customer features.

### Demo User Operations

-   The demo user is automatically enabled in development mode.
-   You can toggle the demo user on/off in the developer control panel (top-left corner).
-   The demo user is automatically disabled in a production environment.
-   To manually disable it, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_DUMMY_USER=true` in your environment variables.

### Login Procedure

1.  Access `/login`.
2.  Use the demo credentials or click the "Enter Demo Account Information" button.
3.  Click login to access all features, including AI support.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family from Vercel.
